            <p> &emsp; &emsp; Elmo Kennedy O'Connor (born January 11, 1994), known professionally as Bones (stylized sometimes as BONES), is an American rapper, singer and songwriter from Howell, Michigan. 
                He is also the founder of the music collective TeamSESH.

                O'Connor is known for his pioneering work in sub-genres of hip-hop referred to as emo rap and trap metal. Since 2010, O'Connor has released an extensive discography and 
                developed a large fan base. As of 2019, he has released over 80 albums, mixtapes and EPs across several aliases.

            <p> &emsp; &emsp; Although O'Connor is often considered to be one of the pioneers of the emo rap sub-genre, O'Connor has said that he has no specific genre, though has been characterized as cloud 
                rap, experimental hip-hop and "shadow rap". O'Connor's earlier music is a lot more futuristic (and is often compared to SpaceGhostPurrp's) than his current music,
                 which showcases production and vocal styles ranging from rapping, singing, and screaming. O'Connor's singing has been compared to grunge and emo, while his rapping has been 
                 compared sub-genres such as horrorcore and emo rap. He is also considered an early pioneer of trap metal.

                O'Connor rarely talks about his musical influences, although during interviews he has mentioned Marvin Gaye, Earth Wind and Fire, Bootsy Collins, Stevie Nicks and Joni Mitchell 
                as influences. Over the years of his music career, O'Connor helped underground hip hop develop into new styles and has been noted as "one of the most influential underground 
                artists of the internet age".
